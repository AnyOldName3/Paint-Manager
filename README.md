Paint-Manager
=============

A utility to manage owned paints for model kits and decide what you still need to buy.

This software is currently not executable, as I've not got that far.

Unless otherwise specified, assume all files related to this project are under the GPL v3 licence.

Me specifying otherwise: CMD.exe is part of MS Windows that Github decided I'd want to put in the repository. I'd recommend not doing anything you wouldn't do with other proprietary software.
